- meta is looking for clean thinking
- establish a test case first and go from there
- think about getting the happy case - test case and run it line by line
- now worry about edge cases
- get to brute force if possible
- dont be afraid to ask, talk while you think
- run a few options with the interviewer: 
    prefix sum might be a good idea here ?
    we need somehow utilize the sorted nature of arr here?
    result we need to get the index, so shuffling the original arr might not be good / might be good?
