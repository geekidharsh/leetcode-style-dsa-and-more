# Given an n x n matrix where each of the rows and columns is sorted in ascending order, 
# return the kth smallest element in the matrix.

# Note that it is the kth smallest element in the sorted order, not the kth distinct element.
# You must find a solution with a memory complexity better than O(n2).


# simple approach - works: N2logN
# flatten matrix into a list arr
# sort arr, get the kth element
def kthSmallestFromMatrix(matrix, k):
    row = col = len(matrix) #matrix given is a square
    arr = []
    
    for r in range(row):
        for c in range(col):
            arr.append(matrix[r][c])
    arr.sort()
    return arr[k-1]

# better than sorting, since using heap
def UsingHeap(matrix, k):
    import heapq
    heap = []
    n = len(matrix)

    for r in range(n):
        for c in range(n):
            heappush(heap, matrix[r][c])
    
    for i in range(k-1):
        heapq.heappop(heap)
    return heapq.heappop(heap)
